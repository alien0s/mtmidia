    "artigo":"Former President Donald Trump tore into President Joe Biden in a wide-ranging interview Thursday, suggesting that the administration is knowingly destroying the country and is distrusted by the American people. During an appearance on Fox & Friends, Trump shot back at the president over his 2020 comments, where he suggested that Trump was responsible for American COVID deaths and should not remain in office. Trump largely laid the blame for the continued deaths, which now exceed the lives lost in 2020, on distrust of the current administration and their inability to sell the vaccine to the public. Some people don’t want to take them and that’s their freedom and that’s what we have to do. But, people don’t want to take them because they don’t trust Biden they don’t trust the administration, said the former president. "
